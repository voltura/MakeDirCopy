# MakeDirCopy
Create separate folders for files in current folder
I use this to organise downloaded torrents so that each completed file is in its own folder. This makes it cleaner for use in Kodi. 
To build single exe that does not require any framework to run, use below in VS terminal window;

<code>dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release</code>
